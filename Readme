First Dayâ€™s summary:

Our discussion was about fundamentals of our project. Our project is a food shop focused on dumplings sales. It should have an accounting system with different types of users:
-	Seller or Merchant
-	Customer
-	Administrator

We did a brainstorm and wrote some of the scenarios for our project which it should handle.
After talking with Tariq we decided to use JavaScript and React in our app. For databases we will use Firebase.
